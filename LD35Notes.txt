Brainstorm:
	-You are a space traveler who likes to turn planets into wierd amorphous blobs with a large ray beam. It is your art. ???
		-Randomly Generated Planets. Randomly Generated Enemies. Arrive on planet. As fast as you can shift objects. Deal with enemies for conflict. ???
		-This would be a 2D platformer. I imagine it as looking a little bit like Risk of Rain. 
		-Possibly enjoyable because of it's difficulty.??? Difficulty stems from enemies being as powerful as you.
		Pros:
			-Neat Idea.
			-Funny concept. ("This is my art.")
			-Definitely Fun. 
			-Platformers are easy.
		Cons:
			-Have to program AI. ( Could be very difficult )
			-Have to program complete random generation system. ( This can just be scrapped )
	
	-You are a mage. You have a large collection of blob minions. ( Maybe it grows as you progress )
		-You have skills you can use based on Mana or Cooldowns.
		-These skills transforms your minions into things for certain amount of times. ( Defense or Offense based )
		-Gameplay is strategy of how you spend your mana to adapt to enemy situations.
		Style:
			-I see this type of game as top down. Exploring a world ( The world moves with you )
			-Blobs surround you.
		Pros:
			-Fun. 
			-Good Concept.
			-Mostly easy code. ( For the most part )
		Cons:
			-AI again. 
			-Complex world and movement. ( How I see it currently, can definitely change )
			
	-You hold a base. You are against someone else (AI) with another base.( Blob Castle ) ( Amorphous Arena ) THIS IDEA IS CHOSEN.
		-Your base can spawn various units.
		-Limit units through mana. ( or something )
		-You can control the units. ( Strategically )
		-You do not have complete view of your enemy base. ( More like Starcraft, less like Clash Royale )
		-Units start as blobs.
			-Shapeshift into unit of choice.
		-Battle this way. Gain bonus mana through destroying enemy units.
		-Your goal is to destroy the enemy base, by gaining mana advantage and overpowering the enemy.
		Pros:
			-Awesome Idea.
			-Good practice in RTS style games.
			-Easy map code. Easy movement code ( mouse select maybe )
		Cons:
			-Difficult AI coding. ( If implemented well, most time could be spent here )
			-A little complicated ( Can be simplified )
